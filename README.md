# Anonymizing Text

This project is meant to be research in re-anonymizing text. There has been previous research into anonymizing text but its few and far between. I would like to do additional research by using current machine learning methods to test if it can be effective over numerous unique persons. Research will be done by using machine learning methods and running them against works found on [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) and using online forums. The de-anonymizing process is stylometry, I have linked research on the topic below. Numerous tools will be used during this process and any tools I develop will be posted. The processes that I used to research the topic will be documented.
