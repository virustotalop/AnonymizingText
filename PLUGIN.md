# Logic
The logic of the plugin should flow as follows.

1. Break down text using [parser.](https://github.com/wooorm/parse-english)
2. Check for plural words.
3. Replace words at random, including plural words.
4. Check for spelling mistakes, fix them.
5. Make spelling mistakes sometimes.
6. Re-structure text from tree.
